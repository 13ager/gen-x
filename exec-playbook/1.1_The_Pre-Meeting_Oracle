You will be acting as a strategic meeting preparation analyst. Your task is to analyze business documents and predict the most challenging questions likely to arise in an upcoming meeting, then provide comprehensive preparation materials for each question.

Here are the documents to analyze:

<documents>
{{DOCUMENTS}}
</documents>

Your goal is to thoroughly analyze these documents and predict the 5 toughest, most challenging questions that are likely to surface in tomorrow's meeting. These should be questions that could put you on the spot, challenge key assumptions, expose potential weaknesses, or require detailed justification of strategies or decisions.

Before providing your final answer, use the scratchpad below to work through your analysis:

<scratchpad>
In this space, you should:
- Identify the key themes, decisions, strategies, and data points across all documents
- Note any inconsistencies, gaps, or potential vulnerabilities
- Consider what stakeholders (board members, analysts, executives) typically focus on
- Think about what aspects might be controversial or require strong justification
- Brainstorm potential tough questions from different perspectives
</scratchpad>

For each of the 5 predicted questions, provide:

1. **The Question**: State the exact tough question likely to be asked
2. **Why This Question**: Explain why this question is likely to surface based on the documents (cite specific information from the documents)
3. **Data-Backed Response**: Provide a comprehensive, data-driven answer using information from the documents
4. **Additional Info Needed**: Identify 2-3 specific pieces of additional information, data, or materials you should have ready to strengthen your response

Focus on questions that are:
- Challenging and potentially uncomfortable
- Likely to come from informed stakeholders who have done their homework
- Related to performance, strategy, risks, or decision-making
- Requiring substantive, detailed responses rather than simple yes/no answers

Your final response should contain only your analysis of the 5 toughest predicted questions with all required components for each. Do not repeat the scratchpad content in your final answer.

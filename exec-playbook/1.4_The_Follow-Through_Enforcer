You will analyze a meeting transcript to extract commitments, decisions, and action items, identify potential issues, and draft follow-up messages.

Your task is to carefully review this meeting transcript and extract three types of items:

1. **Commitments**: Promises or agreements made by individuals to complete specific tasks or deliverables
2. **Decisions**: Conclusions reached or choices made during the meeting that will guide future actions
3. **Action Items**: Specific tasks that need to be completed, whether explicitly assigned or implied

For each item you extract, you must identify three potential issues and flag them:

1. **Items without clear owners**: Any commitment, decision, or action item where it's unclear who is responsible
2. **Decisions that contradict previous meetings**: Any decision that appears to conflict with or reverse previous decisions (look for phrases like "we decided last time," "previously we agreed," or similar references)
3. **Commitments with no deadlines**: Any commitment or action item that lacks a specific timeline or due date

Format your analysis as follows:

**COMMITMENTS:**
- [Description of commitment] | Owner: [Name or "UNCLEAR"] | Deadline: [Date or "NO DEADLINE"] | Flags: [List any applicable flags]

**DECISIONS:**
- [Description of decision] | Flags: [List any applicable flags, especially contradictions]

**ACTION ITEMS:**
- [Description of action item] | Owner: [Name or "UNCLEAR"] | Deadline: [Date or "NO DEADLINE"] | Flags: [List any applicable flags]

After completing the extraction, draft personalized follow-up messages for each person who has been assigned commitments or action items. Structure these as:

**FOLLOW-UP MESSAGES:**

**To [Name]:**
[Draft a professional follow-up message summarizing their specific commitments/action items, including deadlines where available, and requesting confirmation or clarification where items were unclear]

If you identify any items without clear owners, include a separate message:

**To Meeting Organizer/Team:**
[Draft a message highlighting items that need owner assignment]

Your final response should include the complete extraction of all commitments, decisions, and action items with appropriate flags, followed by all necessary follow-up messages. Be thorough in your analysis and ensure no significant items from the transcript are missed.

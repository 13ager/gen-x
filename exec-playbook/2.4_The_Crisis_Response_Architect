You are a strategic communications expert tasked with developing crisis response frameworks. A competitor has just made a significant move that requires a coordinated response across different stakeholder groups.

Here is the competitor's major move:
<competitor_move>
{{COMPETITOR_MOVE}}
</competitor_move>

Your task is to draft three distinct response frameworks, each tailored to a specific stakeholder group with different concerns and communication needs:

**Stakeholder Group 1: Employees**
- Primary goal: Build confidence without creating complacency
- Focus on: Internal strength, team resilience, competitive advantages, and continued growth opportunities
- Tone: Motivational but realistic, acknowledging the challenge while emphasizing capability

**Stakeholder Group 2: Investors** 
- Primary goal: Demonstrate strategic differentiation and competitive positioning
- Focus on: Unique value propositions, market positioning, financial stability, and strategic advantages
- Tone: Analytical and confident, emphasizing data-driven competitive advantages

**Stakeholder Group 3: Customers**
- Primary goal: Reinforce stability and ongoing value delivery
- Focus on: Continued service quality, reliability, customer-centric improvements, and long-term partnership
- Tone: Reassuring and service-focused, emphasizing commitment and stability

For each framework, provide:

1. **Key Messages** (3-4 main points tailored to that stakeholder group)
2. **Supporting Talking Points** (specific details and evidence to back up each key message)
3. **What NOT to Say** (specific phrases, topics, or approaches to avoid with that stakeholder group)

Guidelines for your response:
- Ensure each framework feels distinct and appropriate for its intended audience
- Key messages should be concise, memorable, and actionable
- "What NOT to say" sections should include specific examples of counterproductive messaging
- Consider the different information needs, concerns, and decision-making factors for each group
- Maintain consistency in overall strategic positioning while adapting tone and emphasis

Structure your response with clear headings for each stakeholder group, and organize the content under the specified subsections (Key Messages, Supporting Talking Points, What NOT to Say) for easy reference.

Your final response should contain three complete response frameworks that communications teams can immediately use to craft appropriate messaging for each stakeholder group.

## Why This Matters Now

You've survived the shift from memos to email, desktop to cloud, and waterfall to agile. This isn't another tech transition—it's a cognitive multiplier. GPT-5 isn't your intern; it's your sparring partner. Master these patterns, and you'll operate like you have a strategy team on demand, 24/7.

**Core principle**: Precision in, precision out. Vague asks get fortune-cookie wisdom.

## The Essential Ten

### 1. Structured Reasoning for Complex Problems

**Pattern:**
```
You are a [specific role with expertise].
Break this problem into logical steps before giving your final recommendation.
Think deliberately and show your work.
```

**Live Example:**
```
You are a Chief Revenue Officer with 20 years in enterprise SaaS.
Break down how to pivot our outbound sales motion to product-led growth 
without tanking Q3 pipeline. Consider: comp plans, team structure, and 
customer success handoffs. Show your reasoning, then give me the 90-day plan.
```

**Why it works:** Forces systematic thinking vs. GPT's tendency to leap to conclusions. You get the logic chain, not just the answer.

---

### 2. Draft → Debrief → Deliver

**Pattern:**
```
First, produce your best answer.
Then critique it like a [skeptical stakeholder].
Finally, rewrite addressing every weakness you found.
```

**Live Example:**
```
Draft a board memo explaining why we're killing our most profitable product line.
Then critique it as our most skeptical board member would.
Finally, rewrite it to pre-empt those concerns.
```

**Why it works:** Mimics the review cycles you already do, but in seconds. No more "I should have anticipated that question."

---

### 3. Role + Objective + Constraints (The Trinity)

**Pattern:**
```
You are [expert role].
Your goal: [specific measurable objective].
Constraints: [list hard boundaries].
```

**Live Example:**
```
You are our General Counsel.
Your goal: Draft an AI usage policy that protects IP without stifling innovation.
Constraints: 500 words max, plain English (8th-grade level), implementable tomorrow.
```

**Why it works:** Constraints breed creativity. Also prevents GPT from writing a doctoral thesis when you need a decision doc.

---

### 4. Progressive Deepening

**Pattern:**
```
Level 1: Give me the executive summary of [topic].
Level 2: Now drill into the most critical component with data.
Level 3: Give me three non-obvious implications.
```

**Live Example:**
```
Level 1: Executive summary of how GenAI impacts our consulting business model.
Level 2: Deep dive on the pricing/margin implications with benchmarks.
Level 3: Three second-order effects our competitors haven't considered yet.
```

**Why it works:** Matches how senior leaders actually consume information—headline, then selective deep dives.

---

### 5. The Synthesis Engine

**Pattern:**
```
Input 1: [paste document/data]
Input 2: [different source]
Task: Synthesize into [specific format] highlighting [what matters].
```

**Live Example:**
```
Input 1: Last quarter's customer churn data
Input 2: Product roadmap for next 6 months
Task: Create a one-page retention strategy linking specific features to churn drivers. 
Use a simple table showing Feature → Churn Factor → Expected Impact.
```

**Why it works:** GPT-5 excels at pattern-matching across disparate inputs—like having McKinsey's research team on tap.

---

### 6. Scenario Branching

**Pattern:**
```
Here's our situation: [context].
Map out three scenarios: pessimistic, realistic, optimistic.
For each, give me key indicators to watch and trigger points for action.
```

**Live Example:**
```
Situation: We're considering a $50M Series B in this market.
Map three funding scenarios with different valuations and dilution.
Include warning signals for each path and decision triggers for pivoting.
```

**Why it works:** Builds your peripheral vision for strategic optionality—crucial when markets shift fast.

---

### 7. The Bezos Method (Work Backwards)

**Pattern:**
```
End state: [desired outcome with specifics].
Work backwards to create the plan.
Include dependencies and risk points.
```

**Live Example:**
```
End state: By Dec 2025, we're the recognized thought leader in AI governance,
measured by 3 tier-1 speaking invitations and 2 board advisor roles.
Work backwards to build the 18-month authority-building campaign.
```

**Why it works:** Starts with clarity on success, then reverse-engineers the path—avoiding activity without progress.

---

### 8. Cognitive Diversity Simulator

**Pattern:**
```
Analyze this [decision/strategy] from three perspectives:
1. [Stakeholder 1]: Their priorities and concerns
2. [Stakeholder 2]: Their priorities and concerns  
3. [Stakeholder 3]: Their priorities and concerns
Then integrate into a balanced recommendation.
```

**Live Example:**
```
Analyze our remote-first policy from:
1. CFO: Cost and productivity metrics
2. CHRO: Talent retention and culture
3. Individual contributors: Career development and work-life balance
Integrate into a policy that addresses all three.
```

**Why it works:** Prevents blind spots from single-lens thinking. Like having your entire C-suite in one prompt.

---

### 9. The Stress Test

**Pattern:**
```
Here's my [strategy/plan/argument].
Play devil's advocate aggressively.
Find three ways it could catastrophically fail.
Then tell me how to hedge against each.
```

**Live Example:**
```
Strategy: We're moving all customer data to a single cloud provider for efficiency.
Attack this plan like you're our Chief Risk Officer after three espressos.
Give me the disaster scenarios and mitigation tactics.
```

**Why it works:** Better to find holes in private with GPT than public with your board.

---

### 10. The Clarity Refinery

**Pattern:**
```
Here's my rough thinking: [brain dump].
Transform this into:
1. Core message (one sentence)
2. Three supporting points
3. One compelling metaphor
4. Call to action
```

**Live Example:**
```
Rough thinking: We need to somehow get sales and product to stop fighting 
about roadmap priorities while also making customers happy but not 
over-promising and maybe we need better processes or different meetings...

Transform into a crisp all-hands message.
```

**Why it works:** Turns executive stream-of-consciousness into communication that lands.

## Advanced Patterns

### The Canonical Reference

Build a "source of truth" context that persists across prompts:

```
For all responses in this chat, assume:
- Company: B2B SaaS, $50M ARR, 200 employees
- Market: Competitive, 15% annual growth
- Challenge: Scaling without losing agility
- North Star: IPO-ready in 24 months
```

### The Expertise Ladder

When you need deep technical insight:

```
Explain [complex topic] at three levels:
1. Board level (strategic implications)
2. VP level (operational requirements)
3. Engineer level (implementation details)
Flag the transitions between levels.
```

### The What-If Machine

For strategic planning:

```
Starting position: [current state]
Variable to change: [specific factor]
Map out implications if this variable moves to:
- 50% of current
- 200% of current
- Goes to zero
Include second-order effects.
```

## Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Getting generic MBA-speak | Add "Be specific with examples from [industry]" |
| Too much hedging ("it depends") | Add "Take a position and defend it" |
| Overwhelming detail | Add "Executive summary first, then support" |
| Missing nuance | Add "Consider edge cases and exceptions" |
| Dated references | Add "Use examples from 2024-2025" |

## The Meta-Prompt

When stuck, use this:

```
I have a fuzzy goal around [topic].
Help me convert this into a precise prompt that will get me 
a useful answer. Ask me clarifying questions if needed.
```

---

## Quick Reference Card

**For Strategy**: Use Progressive Deepening or Scenario Branching  
**For Communication**: Use Draft → Debrief → Deliver or Clarity Refinery  
**For Decision-Making**: Use Stress Test or Cognitive Diversity Simulator  
**For Planning**: Use Bezos Method or What-If Machine  
**For Problem-Solving**: Use Structured Reasoning or Synthesis Engine

## Remember

You learned to code in BASIC, built companies through the dot-com bust, and figured out social media when it was still called "Web 2.0." This is just another tool in your arsenal—but one that amplifies judgment rather than replacing it.

The executives who master these patterns won't just survive the AI transition; they'll lead it.

You will analyze a meeting transcript to extract commitments, decisions, and action items, identify potential issues, and draft follow-up messages. Here is the transcript to analyze:

{{TRANSCRIPT}}

Your task is to carefully review this transcript and extract three types of items:

**Commitments**: Promises or agreements made by individuals to complete specific tasks or deliverables
**Decisions**: Conclusions reached or choices made during the meeting that will guide future actions
**Action Items**: Specific tasks that need to be completed, whether explicitly assigned or implied

For each item you extract, identify the following information:
- What the commitment/decision/action item is
- Who is responsible (the "owner")
- Any mentioned deadline or timeframe
- Relevant context from the meeting

After extracting all items, you must flag three types of problematic situations:

1. **Items without clear owners**: Any commitment, decision, or action item where it's unclear who is responsible
2. **Decisions that contradict previous meetings**: Any decisions mentioned that conflict with or reverse previous decisions (look for phrases like "we decided last time" or "previously we agreed")
3. **Commitments with no deadlines**: Any commitment or action item that lacks a specific deadline or timeframe

For each person who has been assigned commitments or action items, draft a brief, professional follow-up message that:
- Summarizes their specific commitments/action items
- Includes any relevant deadlines
- Is written in a helpful, collaborative tone
- Can be sent via email or messaging platform

Format your response as follows:

**EXTRACTED ITEMS:**
[List all commitments, decisions, and action items with owners and deadlines where available]

**FLAGGED ISSUES:**
[Identify items without owners, contradictory decisions, and commitments without deadlines]

**FOLLOW-UP MESSAGES:**
[Draft individual messages for each person with assigned items]

Your final response should focus on providing a comprehensive extraction of actionable items, clearly identifying problematic gaps, and creating ready-to-send follow-up communications that will help ensure accountability and follow-through.

## Why Gen X needs this

Look, we're the bridge generation. We remember life before the internet but adapted to every damn thing technology threw at us. We're not digital natives, we're digital survivors. These prompts aren't about replacing our experience—they're about amplifying it.

We've got:
* Pattern recognition from decades of "transformative initiatives"
* Bullshit detection finely tuned by countless reorgs
* Actual human skills (remember those?)
* The ability to function without constant validation

These prompts help you leverage all that while speaking fluent AI.

## Contributing

Got a prompt that's saved your bacon? Share it. Open a PR or drop an issue. Keep it real, keep it useful, and remember—we're the generation that can still write in complete sentences.

### Contribution guidelines
1. **Test your prompts** - If it doesn't work, it doesn't ship
2. **Include context** - When and why to use it
3. **Show results** - Real examples > theoretical benefits
4. **Keep it practical** - We're too old for productivity theater

## Support

Found these useful? Great. Share them with another Gen-Xer trying to navigate the AI revolution. We're all in this together, even if we'll never admit we need help.

## License

MIT - Because we remember when software was actually free, not "freemium"

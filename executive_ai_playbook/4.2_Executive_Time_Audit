## The Prompt

You will be creating a weekly executive dashboard by analyzing data from multiple sources. Your goal is to provide actionable insights about time allocation, decision bottlenecks, escalating issues, and personal bottlenecks.

Here are the data sources to analyze:

<data_sources>
{{DATA_SOURCES}}
</data_sources>

Here are the strategic priorities to reference:

<strategic_priorities>
{{STRATEGIC_PRIORITIES}}
</strategic_priorities>

Use the scratchpad below to organize your analysis before creating the final dashboard:

First, analyze the data sources to identify:
- Time allocation patterns across different activities and meetings
- Decisions that have been pending for more than one week
- Issues that appear to be escalating without clear resolution paths
- Situations where you appear to be blocking progress for others

Then, map activities and time spent to the strategic priorities listed. Look for misalignments between stated priorities and actual time allocation.

Finally, develop specific, actionable recommendations for reallocating time and attention.

Create a comprehensive weekly executive dashboard with the following four sections:

**1. Time Spent Per Strategic Priority**
- Calculate total hours/percentage of time allocated to each strategic priority
- Include both direct work time and related meetings/communications
- Identify any strategic priorities that received insufficient attention
- Show comparison to ideal allocation if discernible from context

**2. Decisions Pending >1 Week**
- List all decisions that have been outstanding for more than one week
- Include the decision topic, stakeholders involved, and how long it's been pending
- Identify what information or input is needed to move each decision forward
- Prioritize decisions by potential impact and urgency

**3. Issues Escalating Without Resolution**
- Identify problems or challenges that appear to be growing worse over time
- Note how long each issue has been ongoing
- Assess the potential impact if left unresolved
- Identify what resources or actions are needed for resolution

**4. Where You're the Bottleneck**
- Identify situations where others are waiting on your input, approval, or decision
- List team members or projects that may be blocked by your availability
- Note any recurring patterns in bottleneck situations
- Assess the urgency and impact of each bottleneck

**Specific Reallocation Recommendations**
For each section above, provide concrete, actionable recommendations including:
- Specific time blocks to reallocate and to which priorities
- Decisions that should be delegated or expedited
- Issues that need immediate attention or resource allocation
- Processes or systems that could reduce future bottlenecks

Your final output should be a clear, executive-level dashboard that can be quickly scanned for key insights and immediate action items. Focus on being specific rather than general in your recommendations - include actual time amounts, specific meetings to reschedule, particular decisions to prioritize, and concrete next steps.

Format your response as a professional executive dashboard with clear headers, bullet points, and actionable recommendations. Do not include the scratchpad content in your final response.

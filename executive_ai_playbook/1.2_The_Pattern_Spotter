# 1.2 Pattern Spotter: Identify High-Value Meetings

## What this does
Reviews your recent meeting transcripts to identify recurring patternsâ€”decisions that keep getting deferred, topics that consume time without outcomes, and who actually drives resolution vs. discussion. Creates an "action velocity score" for each participant and recommends structural changes to reclaim wasted time.

## The Prompt

You will be analyzing leadership meeting transcripts to identify patterns in decision-making, discussion dynamics, and participant effectiveness. Your goal is to spot recurring issues and evaluate how different participants contribute to actionable outcomes.

You need to conduct a comprehensive analysis across three key dimensions:

**1. Deferred Decisions Analysis**
Identify decisions that appear repeatedly across multiple meetings without resolution. For each deferred decision:
- Note how many times it appears
- Identify the stated reasons for deferral
- Look for patterns in the types of decisions being deferred
- Determine if the same obstacles keep arising

**2. Time-Consuming Non-Productive Topics**
Identify discussion topics that consume significant meeting time but consistently fail to produce concrete outcomes, decisions, or next steps. Look for:
- Topics that generate lengthy discussion but end without resolution
- Recurring debates that circle back to the same points
- Issues that consume time disproportionate to their importance or urgency

**3. Participant Behavior Patterns**
Analyze each meeting participant to distinguish between those who drive toward resolution versus those who primarily contribute to discussion. Look for:
- Who proposes concrete next steps, deadlines, or solutions
- Who asks clarifying questions that move discussions forward
- Who tends to extend discussions without adding actionable value
- Who successfully pushes for decisions and follow-through

**Action Velocity Score Criteria**
Create a score from 1-10 for each participant based on:
- Resolution-driving behaviors (proposing solutions, setting deadlines, pushing for decisions): Higher weight
- Quality of contributions (actionable insights vs. general commentary): Medium weight  
- Follow-through mentions (references to completing prior commitments): Medium weight
- Discussion efficiency (concise, focused contributions vs. lengthy tangents): Lower weight

Before providing your final analysis, use the scratchpad below to work through your observations systematically.

Your final response should include:

1. **Deferred Decisions Summary**: List the top 3-5 decisions that keep getting deferred, with frequency counts and the main reasons for deferral

2. **Time-Sink Topics**: Identify 2-4 topics that consume disproportionate time without generating outcomes

3. **Participant Analysis**: For each participant, provide:
   - Their primary behavioral pattern (resolution-driver vs. discussion-driver)
   - Specific examples of their contributions
   - Their action velocity score with brief justification
   - Key strengths and areas for improvement

4. **Overall Patterns**: Summarize the most significant patterns affecting meeting effectiveness

Format your final analysis clearly with headers and bullet points. Focus on actionable insights that could help improve future meeting effectiveness.

You will identify the top 5 strategic risks facing an organization and develop a complete risk management framework including cascading effects analysis, early warning systems, and competitive advantage opportunities.

Your analysis should focus on strategic risks - those that could fundamentally impact the organization's ability to achieve its long-term objectives, competitive position, or business model viability. These are distinct from operational risks that affect day-to-day activities.

Before providing your final analysis, use your internal reasoning to work through the risk identification and prioritization process in <analysis> tags. Consider the business context carefully to identify risks that are most relevant and impactful to this specific organization.

For your final response, structure your analysis as follows:

**STRATEGIC RISK ASSESSMENT**

For each of the top 5 strategic risks, provide:

**Risk [Number]: [Risk Name]**
- **Description**: Brief explanation of the risk and why it's strategic
- **Probability**: High/Medium/Low with brief justification
- **Impact**: High/Medium/Low with brief justification
- **Risk Score**: Overall priority ranking explanation

**2nd Order Effects**: Direct consequences if this risk materializes
**3rd Order Effects**: Cascading impacts from the 2nd order effects

**Early Warning Indicators**:
- List 3-5 specific, measurable indicators that would signal this risk is increasing
- Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative signals where appropriate

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Identify 2-3 mitigation approaches that reduce risk exposure without limiting growth opportunities
- Explain how each strategy preserves or enhances competitive positioning

**Competitive Advantage Opportunities**:
- Describe how proactive management of this risk could create competitive differentiation
- Identify specific ways defensive moves could become offensive advantages

**Trigger Points for Action**:
- Define specific thresholds or conditions that would prompt immediate action
- Include both preventive triggers (early intervention) and reactive triggers (damage control)

After analyzing all 5 risks, provide:

**INTEGRATED RISK PORTFOLIO VIEW**
- Brief assessment of how these risks interact with each other
- Identification of any risk clusters or cascading scenarios
- Overall portfolio risk level and key interdependencies

Your final response should focus on actionable insights that enable proactive risk management while maintaining strategic agility. Ensure all recommendations are specific to the business context provided and avoid generic risk management advice.

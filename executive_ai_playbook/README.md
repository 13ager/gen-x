## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use These Prompts

1. **Copy verbatim** - Start with the prompt as written
2. **Adapt brackets** - Replace [placeholders] with your context
3. **Run it** - Use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or your company's LLM
4. **Refine output** - Second pass if needed (usually isn't)
5. **Deploy** - Use the results today

**Don't overthink it.** Executives winning right now aren't perfecting prompts‚Äîthey started 18 months ago.

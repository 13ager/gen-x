# 3.4 Resource Allocation Optimizer: Kill Pet Projects, Fund Winners

## What this does
Models optimal resource allocation across competing initiatives by analyzing expected ROI, strategic option value, organizational capacity, and portfolio balance. Provides specific recommendations on what to fund, kill, or reduce scope—with political cover for each cut.

## The Prompt

You are a strategic resource allocation analyst tasked with optimizing resource distribution across proposed initiatives. You will be provided with strategic priorities, current resource deployment, and proposed initiatives to analyze.

<strategic_priorities>
{{STRATEGIC_PRIORITIES}}
</strategic_priorities>

<current_resources>
{{CURRENT_RESOURCES}}
</current_resources>

<proposed_initiatives>
{{PROPOSED_INITIATIVES}}
</proposed_initiatives>

Your task is to model the optimal allocation of resources across the proposed initiatives by analyzing four key dimensions:

1. **Expected ROI**: Calculate projected return on investment for each initiative based on estimated costs, benefits, and timeframes
2. **Risk-adjusted returns**: Adjust ROI calculations for probability of success, market risks, execution risks, and other uncertainty factors
3. **Strategic option value**: Assess how each initiative creates future opportunities, competitive advantages, or strategic flexibility
4. **Organizational capacity**: Evaluate resource requirements against available capacity, including personnel, budget, technology, and operational constraints

For your analysis:
- Consider how each initiative aligns with the stated strategic priorities
- Account for current resource deployment and any constraints or dependencies
- Model different allocation scenarios and their trade-offs
- Identify initiatives that may be complementary or competing for the same resources

For the sensitivity analysis, test key assumptions including:
- Changes in expected returns (±20% and ±50%)
- Probability of success variations
- Resource availability constraints
- Timeline modifications
- Strategic priority weightings

Use the scratchpad below to work through your calculations, assumptions, and reasoning before providing your final recommendation.

[Use this space to:
- Analyze each initiative across the four dimensions
- Calculate scores and weightings
- Model different allocation scenarios
- Perform sensitivity analysis
- Work through trade-offs and dependencies]
</scratchpad>

Your final answer should include:
1. **Recommended Resource Allocation**: Specific percentage or dollar amounts allocated to each initiative with clear justification
2. **Optimization Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of how each initiative scores on the four key dimensions
3. **Sensitivity Analysis Results**: How your recommendations change under different assumption scenarios
4. **Implementation Considerations**: Key risks, dependencies, and capacity constraints to monitor
5. **Alternative Scenarios**: At least two alternative allocation models with their respective trade-offs

Present your final recommendation and analysis inside <answer> tags. Focus on actionable insights and clear rationale for your allocation decisions rather than showing all computational work.
